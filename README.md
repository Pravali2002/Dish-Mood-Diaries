# Dish-Mood-Diaries
Living alone, I quickly realized that the toughest part of my day was figuring out what to eat. I’d often call my mom for help, only to hear, “You decide what to cook today!” That’s when the idea hit me: why not create an AI that understands my mood and suggests the perfect dish based on how I’m feeling?

With that, I embarked on building a mood-driven food recommendation system, blending AI and culinary preferences to make meal decisions easier and more personalized.Currently still developing to refine recommendations and integrate more advanced features!

The below is a retro 1980s-themed web app that uses AI to gamify your snack choices. By analyzing your mood, dietary preference, and cuisine choice, it generates a simple, personalized snack recipe accompanied by a motivational "Power-Up" message. The experience features an immersive arcade interface with neon visuals, playful pixel-art animations (like a face drinking soda), and custom-generated 3-panel pixel art instruction strips for every dish.
