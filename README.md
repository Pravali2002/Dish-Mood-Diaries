# Dish-Mood-Diaries
Living alone, I quickly realized that the toughest part of my day was figuring out what to eat. I’d often call my mom for help, only to hear, “You decide what to cook today!” That’s when the idea hit me: why not create an AI that understands my mood and suggests the perfect dish based on how I’m feeling?

With that, I embarked on building a mood-driven food recommendation system, blending AI and culinary preferences to make meal decisions easier and more personalized.Currently still developing to refine recommendations and integrate more advanced features!
